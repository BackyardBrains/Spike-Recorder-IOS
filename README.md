Backyard-Brains-iOS-App
=======================

It's like having a complete neuroscience rig in your pocket!  This app allows you to view brain signals just like
neuroscientsits do.  With the SpikerBox (available open-source from http://backyardbrains.com) you can 
listen to living neurons from insects, and muscles from humans.  With this app, you can also view what the spikes 
of neurons look like and record it to your iOS device for later analysis. 
What used to take up a whole room you now have in your hand, and for cheap. Think of it!

This Grasshopper branch is made for [Investigating Grasshopper Vision](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/grasshoppervision) experiment. 

In order to run the project you will need:
- macOS 
- [xCode IDE](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
